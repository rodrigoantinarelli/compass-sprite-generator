##Spriting has never been easier than it is with Compass

###Step by step

- In terminal, run:

`$ git clone https://github.com/rodrigoantinarelli/compass-sprite-generator`

- After cloned, open the file **config.rb** within the project folder.

- In **http_path** place the correct folder path and save.

- Put all your images inside the folder **images/sprites**.

- Open terminal again, **cd path/to/folder** and run:

`$ compass compile`

- Sprite will be generated inside **images** folder.

- CSS will be generated inside **stylesheets** folder.

Yes, that's it.
